OOP Assignment 2

Overview : This assignment has five questions related to recursion, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
I solved all the questions applying the concepts we learned in oop class & lab.

Question 1
In this question, I made two recursive functions.
The first one, ChangeLocation, changes the position of characters in a character array between two given indexes.
The second one, PrintPattern, prints a number pattern using recursion.

Question 2 
This question was about creating a linked list to store different types of features like land and water.
I made a base class called Feature and two child classes named LandFeature and WaterFeature.
Each one prints its own type of message using the analyze function.
I also made a SinglyLinkedList class that can add, delete, display, and reverse the list.

Question 3 
This program is about a simple library system.
It keeps track of books using a doubly linked list.
The program can add and delete books and also show them in forward and reverse order.

Question 4 
This question is about a movie ticket booking system using a queue.
Each customer has an ID, name, and number of tickets.
The program can add a new customer (enqueue), remove the first one (dequeue), and show the full queue.

Question 5 
In this question, I made two stacks one using a linked list and one using a dynamic array.
I used both stacks to make iterative versions of the recursion questions from Question 1.
At the end, I compared their time complexity and performance to see which one works faster.
